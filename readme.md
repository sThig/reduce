# TALLY STUFF
Learned about Reduce.  that was kinda cool, as well as "mod" which is the percent sign and it will say what's left after evenly distributed.

# TIL
* using reduce
* using data attribute data-time
* nodeList vs Array (and converting it)
* can select stuff as an array using Array.from
* more focus on split
* reduce takes in an array and returns anything you want
* mod? % how many are left after they are evenly distributed
